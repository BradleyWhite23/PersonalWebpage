# Portfolio Project Outline: Figma + WordPress

---

## 1. Project Overview

**Goal:**  
Build a professional portfolio website that highlights your web development skills, IT/networking background, and ability to use industry-standard tools (Figma & WordPress).

---

## 2. Design Phase (Figma)

- **Wireframes**
  - Home/About page: Personal intro, skills, certifications, and quick links.
  - Projects page: Gallery/cards for each project with screenshots, live links, descriptions, and tech stack.
  - Contact page: Simple contact form, social links.
  - (Bonus) Network Monitoring Dashboard mockup: Visualize how you’d design a dashboard UI.

- **High-Fidelity Mockups**
  - Refine wireframes into polished designs.
  - Apply a consistent color palette and typography.
  - Export images and/or share Figma project link.

- **Documentation**
  - For each design, add short notes on UX decisions.
  - Save/export designs for use in your WordPress build and README.

## 3. Development Phase (WordPress)

- **Set Up WordPress**
  - Choose hosting (local or online—e.g., LocalWP, Netlify, or shared host).
  - Install WordPress.

- **Theme Selection & Customization**
  - Select a base theme (e.g., Astra, Hello Elementor, or Twenty Twenty-Four).
  - Customize theme to match your Figma designs (CSS tweaks, custom header/footer).
  - (Optional) Create a child theme for deeper customization.

- **Content Creation**
  - Home/About: Use blocks or custom templates for introduction and skills.
  - Projects:  
    - Create custom post type or use a plugin (e.g., WP Portfolio).
    - Add project details—screenshots (from Figma), descriptions, GitHub/live links.
  - Contact: Add a form (WPForms, Contact Form 7, or built-in block).
  - Blog: (Optional) Share learning experiences or technical posts.

- **Plugins**
  - Portfolio gallery/plugin.
  - Contact form plugin.
  - Security (Wordfence, iThemes Security).

## 4. Network Monitoring Dashboard Concept

- **Design:**  
  - Include Figma mockup in your projects section.
  - (Optional) Build a static demo page in WordPress to simulate dashboard functionality.

- **Description:**

## 5. Deployment & Documentation

- **Deploy Website:**  
  - Publish WordPress site (Netlify, Vercel, shared hosting, etc.).
  - Make sure all content and projects are visible and working.

- **README/Case Study:**  
  - Summarize design workflow (with Figma links/screenshots).
  - Describe WordPress build process (theme, plugins, custom code).
  - Document technical decisions, challenges, and solutions.
  - Include links to live site, Figma project, and GitHub repo.

- **Screenshots & Media:**
